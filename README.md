Hello, Powercoders team!

This is a portfolio website for myself as a photographer.
I wanted to make it simple, understandable and concentrated on photos without any distracting elements.
It doesn't have a lot of fancy JS stuff yet, it's more or less responsive, but there's still some features that I want to add or improve later.

Thank you for this task, it was difficult to start, but the further I go, the more interesting it became and I was eager to work on it.
We have a lot of things to do in the bootcamp and I don't have enough time for it.
But I love the general idea and maybe will use this template to create a real website for myself in future.
